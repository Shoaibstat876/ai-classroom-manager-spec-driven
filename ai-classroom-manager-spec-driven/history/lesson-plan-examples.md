## Example 1 — Grade 8 Science (Kinematics)

# Lesson Plan — Introduction to Rest and Motion

**Class:** Grade 8  
**Subject:** Science (Physics — Kinematics)  
**Duration:** 40 minutes  
**Teaching Style:** Activity-based  

---

## Learning Objectives
- Define rest and motion in simple words.  
- Explain that rest and motion are relative to the observer.  
- Identify real-life examples of rest and motion.  

---

## Materials Required
- Whiteboard and markers  
- A ball or small object  
- Student chairs and desks  

---

## Introduction (Engage)
- Teacher asks students: “Are you at rest or in motion right now?”  
- Take a few answers and highlight different opinions.  
- Briefly explain that rest and motion depend on the observer.  

---

## Main Activities (Explore & Explain)
1. **Demonstration:** Teacher stands still and asks, “Am I in motion?” Then walks and asks again.  
2. **Class Discussion:**  
   - Define **rest**: body not changing position with respect to surroundings.  
   - Define **motion**: body changing position with respect to surroundings.  
3. **Examples from Classroom:**  
   - Student sitting on chair (rest).  
   - Student walking to the board (motion).  
4. **Pair Work:** Students in pairs list 3 examples of rest and 3 of motion from daily life.

---

## Assessment (Evaluate)
- Ask 3 short questions orally:  
  1. Define rest.  
  2. Define motion.  
  3. Give one example of each.  

---

## Homework
- Write 5 examples of rest and 5 examples of motion from your home or street.  

---

## Teacher Notes
- Ensure shy students are gently invited to share examples.  
- Remind students that rest and motion always depend on a reference point.

## Example 2 — Grade 5 Science (Water Cycle)

# Lesson Plan — The Water Cycle

**Class:** Grade 5  
**Subject:** Science  
**Duration:** 35 minutes  
**Teaching Style:** Simple explanation with drawing  

---

## Learning Objectives
- Name the main stages of the water cycle.  
- Explain evaporation, condensation, and precipitation in simple words.  
- Relate the water cycle to rain they see in daily life.  

---

## Materials Required
- Board and markers  
- A picture of clouds/rain (optional)  

---

## Introduction (Engage)
- Ask students: “Where does rain come from?”  
- Take 2–3 answers and connect them to the idea of the **water cycle**.  

---

## Main Activities (Explore & Explain)
1. **Explanation:**  
   - Evaporation: water changing to vapour when heated.  
   - Condensation: vapour cooling and forming clouds.  
   - Precipitation: water falling as rain.  
2. **Board Drawing:** Teacher draws a simple water cycle diagram and labels the 3 stages.  
3. **Student Participation:**  
   - Students copy a simple diagram in their notebooks.  

---

## Assessment (Evaluate)
- Ask students to name the three stages of the water cycle.  
- One volunteer explains the cycle in 3–4 sentences.  

---

## Homework
- Draw the water cycle neatly in your notebook and label the three main stages.  

---

## Teacher Notes
- Keep explanations short and in very simple language.  
- Help weaker students with spelling of key words.
