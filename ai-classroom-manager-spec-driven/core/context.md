# /sp-context — AI Classroom Manager Agent (Spec-Driven Edition)

## 1. Project Identity

- **Project Name:** AI Classroom Manager Agent — Spec-Driven Edition  
- **Owner:** Muhammad Shoaib  
- **Theme:** Spec-Driven AI assistant for school teachers  
- **Hackathon Stack:** Claude + Gemini + Spec-Kit + Docusaurus + GitHub

This project follows the pattern:

> Constitution → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation

Pattern quality is more important than writing style.

- Produce timetables and class schedules  
- Create parent messages & behaviour notes  
- Generate progress summaries  
- Provide emergency backup lesson plans  
- Document everything using Docusaurus  
- Follow a strict spec-driven development workflow

## 4. High-Level Capabilities (Hackathon Scope)

1. **Lesson & Assessment Tools**
   - Lesson plan generator  
   - Worksheet generator  
   - Quiz/exam generator  

2. **Communication Tools**
   - Parent message templates  
   - Behaviour notes  
   - Basic progress summaries  

3. **Spec-Driven Development**
   - No feature implemented without a spec  
   - Everything follows plan → tasks → implement  

4. **Documentation**
   - Docusaurus site as a “Project Book”  
   - Explains specs, plan, tasks, implementation

## 5. Non-Goals (for hackathon simplicity)

- No full school ERP  
- No complex dashboards  
- No LMS platform  
- No multi-tenant production SaaS  

These are future extensions.

## 6. Tooling Assumptions (Training Mode)

- Claude Pro (to be used after Wednesday)  
- Gemini 3 Pro (as generation engine)  
- Spec-Kit commands: /sp-context, /sp-specify, /sp-plan, /sp-tasks, /sp-implement  
- Docusaurus for documentation  
- GitHub as source control & Pages hosting

## 7. Core Principles

1. **Spec First, Code Later**  
2. **Short Prompts, High Reasoning**  
3. **Token Discipline**  
4. **Zero Vibe Coding**  
5. **Everything Documented in Repo**  
6. **History Summarized, Not Repeated**
